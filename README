Speech-Synthesis

There are all sorts of Speech Synthesis (or Text To Speech) modules
on CPAN, supporting all kinds of different Speech APIs. However, each
of these modules has its own functions and methods, and writing platform-independent
code using these modules is a hell.
Therefore Speech::Synthesis provides one API that supports many different
speech APIs, like Mac::Speech on OS X, Win32::SAPI4, Win32::SAPI5 and
Win32::MSAgent on Win32 platforms, and Festival::Client::Async on all
other platforms. You never have to worry about their different ways: just use
Speech::Synthesis!
